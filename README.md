# Unreal Engine 5 Game Development Course

This repository contains the projects and code developed during the course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" available on Udemy. The course is created in collaboration with Epic Games and provides a comprehensive learning experience for game development using Unreal Engine 5 and C++.

## Course Description
The course is designed to teach participants how to create games in Unreal Engine 5 using C++, the industry-standard language for game development. It covers topics such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), game design principles, programming patterns, and AI behavior programming.

## Projects
Throughout the course, I worked on several projects, each aimed at applying the concepts and techniques learned during the lectures. The projects completed in this course include:

### Project 1: Warehouse Wreckage
**Description:** "Warehouse Wreckage" is a project that focuses on creating a dynamic and visually engaging virtual warehouse environment using Unreal Engine 5. The main aim of this project is to introduce the fundamental concepts of level design, lighting, and basic gameplay mechanics. 

**Goals:**
- Create a detailed warehouse setting with realistic textures and props.
- Implement basic player character movement and camera controls.
- Add interactive elements within the warehouse for player engagement.
- Introduce lighting and ambiance to enhance the atmosphere of the warehouse.

### Project 2: Obstacle Assault

**Description:** "Obstacle Assault" is a project that centers on developing a fun and challenging obstacle course game within Unreal Engine 5. The project introduces level design, character physics, and game mechanics that involve overcoming obstacles and challenges.

**Goals:**
- Design and construct an exciting obstacle course with a variety of challenges.
- Implement character controls for running, jumping, and interacting with the environment.

### Project 3: Crypt Raider

**Description:** "Crypt Raider" is an adventurous project that delves into the creation of a crypt or tomb exploration game. This project introduces more advanced level design, lighting, and asset management techniques, while also emphasizing the development of a gripping narrative within the game.

**Goals:**
- Construct a crypt environment with intricate puzzles, traps, and storytelling elements.
- Develop a player character with advanced movement and interaction capabilities.
- Enhance the overall gaming experience through atmospheric lighting.


### Project 4: Toon Tanks

**Description:** "Toon Tanks" is a visually distinct project that focuses on developing a stylized, cartoon-themed tank battle game. This project introduces concepts of character animation, stylized art design, and basic AI implementation for enemy tanks.

**Goals:**
- Design and model cartoon-style tanks and environments.
- Implement tank character animations, including movement, shooting, and explosions.
- Develop basic enemy AI for tank opponents.
- Create an engaging and entertaining multiplayer or single-player tank battle experience.

### Project 5: Simple Shooter

**Description:** "Simple Shooter" is a project that advances into the realm of first-person shooter (FPS) game development. This project is designed to offer insights into creating a more complex and dynamic game with FPS mechanics, AI enemies, and player-versus-environment (PvE) gameplay.

**Goals:**
- Construct a 3D environment for a first-person shooter game.
- Develop a player character with movement, shooting, and weapon switching mechanics.
- Implement AI-controlled enemies with various behaviors and attack patterns.
- Create engaging and challenging PvE gameplay with objectives and scoring.
